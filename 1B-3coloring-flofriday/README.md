Tutor said that C-code should not exceed the 80-character limit.

## About this solution
My solution has to implementations to solve this problem. By default the faster
one is build with `make all`. However, since this is not the algorithm that is 
described in the instructions, I also implemented the specified algorithm which
can be build with `make all-slow`. In the C code the implementations arw 
switched with the `SLOW_ALGO` flag.

Also the argument-parsing in the generator is not the best.
