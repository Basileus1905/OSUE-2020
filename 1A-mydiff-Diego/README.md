## About this solution

I tried to add a lot of documentation to my code so other people can easily read and understand my solution.

In case you want to get a deeper understanding you can use the "debug" makro. For example in line 79 in file _mydiff.c_

```c
debug("Reading file %s", filename);
```

Pro tip: always make sure you close all the resources like file open etc and free allocated memory.
